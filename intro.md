# PyClifford - an python based simulator for Clifford-dominated quantum circuits

This is a `python` based clifford circuit simulation package which not only offers the fast simulation but also supports analytical level manipulation of pauli operators and stabilizer states. It also supports quantum circuit (strong/weak) simulations that include a few T-gates.

This open-source project is kindly supported by [the Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund/grants.html)
